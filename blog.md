## Introduction

My name is Shashwat Pandey, I've been a software engineer since 2019 and this page exists mainly to organize my thoughts and occasionally be used to describe what I've learned and how to grow from those situations.

## Education & Internships

Graduating from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) with a Computer Engineering degree, I've never really had much professional experience within the lower levels of programming. My classes in those subjects were immensely interesting but I could never really visualize what I was building, thus over time, I moved to higher order (only in terms of abstraction not complexity) programming.

My internships started off with Mobile programming with Android with the bulky Android Studio for Java. The only reason I was ever to get a start in programming right way was my great experience building my own company, the now defunct [Davai](/davai.md) - I truly wish I could buy back that domain but it's going for something like $300 / yr, truly not worth it.

The only problem that I remember from my internships that I was even remotely proud of was when I was working for a company that was developing a Sports application for Android. At that moment in time Android was far inferior to iOS in terms of developer friendly UI configurability and animations (something to look into) [Android vs iOS](/android-vs-ios.md).

The task was to create a parallax type of movement on a large picture (to move back and forth across a picture). While this was fairly simple to accomplish on iOS, Android did not have a built-in parallax feature. Thus, I was tasked with rendering a large image but having to move a Android view across the image. To me, this was a task that took me a couple of days, since it was the first time that actually required math to be done while programming. I don't fully remember the math I came up with, but it was something like over a configurable amount of seconds, I would move the image underneath the view making sure the frame of view was always showing the middle of the image.

## Professional Experience

Starting in 2019, I joined IBM full-time in the Consulting division under the Data Platform Services Practice, where my last internship had taken place before the end of my education. The main attraction I had to this team was the focus towards problem solving, even while I was an intern, I was handed a full project (something mostly inconsequential) where I had my first taste at not only Data Engineering but also designing, deploying infrastructure and architecture as well and I was just asked to complete the task.

While a little naive, I thought that was great, no bounds on code quality, infrastructure decisions and a push towards just completing the task.
