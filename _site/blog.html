<p>My name is Shashwat Pandey, I’ve been a software engineer since 2019 and this page exists mainly to organize my thoughts and occasionally be used to describe what I’ve learned and how to grow from those situations.</p>

<h2 id="education--internships">Education &amp; Internships</h2>

<p>Graduating from the University of Waterloo with a Computer Engineering degree, I’ve never really had much professional experience within the lower levels of programming. My classes in those subjects were immensely interesting but I could never really visualize what I was building, thus over time, I moved to higher order (only in terms of abstraction not complexity) programming.</p>

<p>My internships started off with Mobile programming with Android with the bulky Android Studio for Java. The only reason I was ever to get a start in programming right way was my great experience building my own company, the now defunct <a href="/davai.md">Davai</a> - I truly wish I could buy back that domain but it’s going for something like $300 / yr, truly not worth it.</p>

<p>The only problem that I remember from my internships that I was even remotely proud of was when I was working for a company that was developing a Sports application for Android. At that moment in time Android was far inferior to iOS in terms of developer friendly UI configurability and animations (something to look into) <a href="/android-vs-ios.md">Android vs iOS</a>.</p>

<p>The task was to create a parallax type of movement on a large picture (to move back and forth across a picture). While this was fairly simple to accomplish on iOS, Android did not have a built-in parallax feature. Thus, I was tasked with rendering a large image but having to move a Android view across the image. To me, this was a task that took me a couple of days, since it was the first time that actually required math to be done while programming. I don’t fully remember the math I came up with, but it was something like over a configurable amount of seconds, I would move the image underneath the view making sure the frame of view was always showing the middle of the image.</p>
